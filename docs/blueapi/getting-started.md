# Getting started

First, setup your environment variables for authentication. See this [page](https://alphauslabs.github.io/blueapi/authentication/apikey.html) for more information. We recommend you to install our CLI tool, [bluectl](https://github.com/alphauslabs/bluectl). You can use it to validate your authentication, among other features. To validate your environment, run the following command:

```sh
$ bluectl whoami
```

If successful, it will output some information about the authenticated user.
